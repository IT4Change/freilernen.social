    About freilernen.social
  </h2>
  <p>
    The social network freilernen.social allows parents of the Petershausen Active School to connect with each other, especially if they do not come from the same place and are looking to make connections. <br> 
    Since we have all decided in favor of an <b>alternative school</b> for various reasons, this is already the best indication that we also seem to be open to alternatives in other areas of society!
    <br> Just like the <b>alternative free software</b> used to operate this network. 
  </p>
  <p>
More specifically, freilernen is run by Menschheitsfamilie Werkstatt e.V. and is available to ASP students aged 14 and above and their families.    <h4>It should be regarded as common knowledge in digital communication, without evaluation or algorithms.</h4>
    <b>And of course, no chat monitoring!</b><br>
    <br>
    In order to participate in the network, you must have taken part in the school enrollment process in some form. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The operation of the network (domain, hosting, and software maintenance) is jointly financed by voluntary <a href="/donate">donations</a>.
</p>
  <p>
    The network runs on Ocelot.Social software, which is developed by a community of programmers and 
    interested network operators. <br> 
    The software is freely available on <a href="https://github.com/Ocelot-Social-Community/Ocelot-Social/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. 
     It is open source, meaning it can be viewed at any time and freely modified.
