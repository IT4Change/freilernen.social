  <h2>
   <center>The operator (administrator) of the social network Freilernen.social has set the following terms and conditions:</center>
  </h2>
  <p><center>This is the first version (est.: January 24, 2026)</center><p><center>(2 points in advance)</center></p><br>
  
  <p><b>First point:</b><br>It is not necessary to have an <b>account</b> to participate in communication.
  <br> Since membership is voluntary and only mandatory for certain services,<br> which only come into effect when the operator assigns the roles of admin or moderator. <br>And thus, users become <b>free learners.</b></p>
<br>
  <p><b>Second point:</b><br>Our interaction is based on respectful and balanced treatment within the community.<br>
We strive to reflect on and dissolve our conditioning on an equal footing.<br>
To this end, we use communication methods such as theme-centered interaction (TCI),<br>
nonviolent communication, and active listening.<br>
Our interaction is characterized by joint decisions.<br>
Our interaction pursues goal-oriented action.<br>
In the event of conflicts, we strive to find a solution in a factual and clear manner.
</p>
  <br>
 <p><b>Basic conditions for operators:</b><br>
3. A Freilernen admin undertakes to grant at least two different (natural) persons administrator access (root access) to the operating system.<br>
4. A Freilernen Admin undertakes to publicly and unambiguously display their level of control over the hardware and software that hosts the services and associated data.<br>

5. A Freilernen admin undertakes to implement a backup policy that enables daily backups.
6. A Freilernen admin undertakes to permanently delete all information (accounts and personal data) about the user at their request, within the scope of legal and technical obligations.
<br>
<b>Transparency:</b><br>

    2. A Freilernen Admin undertakes to do their best to ensure the security of their infrastructure.<br>
    3. A Freilernen admin undertakes not to claim any property rights to content, data, and metadata produced by users.<br>
    4.

<br>

    2. A Freilernen <b>admin requires the legal guardians registered on Freilernen</b> of registered minors to <b>take on a moderating role.</b><br>   
    3. With a growing number of underage users, a Freilernen administrator may suggest a moderation rotation to the legal guardians of users in order to ensure fair rotation.<br>
4. It is assumed that a ratio of 3 moderators to 20 minors should be sufficient.   <br>
