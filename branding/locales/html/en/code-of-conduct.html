    <b>The basic principles of the Menschheitsfamilie Werkstatt e.v. apply</b>
  </p>
  </center>
  <p><b>(1) Basic principles of personal responsibility</b><br>
<br>
Each and every one of us is responsible for ourselves and our actions.<br>
Each and every one of us focuses our attention on behaving as empathetically as possible.<br>
Each and every one of us bases our actions and behavior on the golden rule:<br> “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you”
and its reversal:<br> "Treat others
as you would like to be treated yourself!"<br>
<br>
<b>(2) Basic principles of coexistence</b><br>
<br>
The personal responsibility of each and every one of us gives rise to the following principles for <br>
constructive and appreciative coexistence, which always remains focused on the topic at hand.

Our coexistence is based on respectful and balanced interaction within the community.<br>
We strive to reflect on and dissolve our conditioning on an equal footing.<br>
To this end, we use communication methods such as theme-centered interaction (TCI),
nonviolent communication, and active listening.<br>
Our cooperation is characterized by joint decisions.<br>
Our cooperation pursues goal-oriented action.<br>
In the event of conflicts, we strive to find a solution in an objective and clear manner.<br>
As the human family, we address issues in a way that is oriented toward the common good and solutions, open-ended,<br>
spacious, objective, and conducive to growth.
Disregard for these principles will be addressed and will have consequences.<br>
These basic principles will remain in effect until they are replaced by a newer version.<br>
